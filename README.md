# Stopwatch System ⏱️🚀

## Overview
The **Stopwatch System** is an embedded C project that implements a digital stopwatch with dual modes: **increment (count-up) and countdown**. It runs on an **ATMEGA32 microcontroller** and is simulated using **Proteus**. 🖥️⚡

## Features
- **Increment Mode** – Stopwatch counts up from zero.
- **Countdown Mode** – Allows users to set a time and count down.
- **Seven-Segment Display** – Time is displayed clearly.
- **User Control** – Start, pause, and reset functionalities.
- **Precise Timing** – Ensures accuracy in both modes. ⏳

## Technology Used
- **Language:** C
- **Microcontroller:** ATMEGA32 ⚙️
- **Simulation Software:** Proteus 🛠️
- **Hardware:** Seven-segment display, push-buttons, Buzzer

## How It Works
The system allows users to switch between modes and control the stopwatch using buttons. Time is displayed on a **six-digit seven-segment display**, making it easy to track elapsed or remaining time.
